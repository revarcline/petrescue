planning!

deploy to heroku âœ”

def gh

bootstrap

get to models

Pet:

`Dog < Pet`
`Cat < Pet`

single table inheritance, but seperate models allow for simpler routing

put methods etc in pet

or is it better to have a specialized controller?



Appointment

flash method for upcoming appointments if within a week

put flash in layout

oauth google
devise

learn bootstrap
